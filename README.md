# Explore the Cosmos Client

The client-side of the `Explore the Cosmos` app
enables users to search NASA's vast repository of
images using both NASA's public API and also
the Google Vision API.

The Google Vision API applies Google-generated
labels to each image, enabling the user to try
searches they might not have thought of.
